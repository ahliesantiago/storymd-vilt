# StoryMd
An [Archive of Our Own (AO3)](https://archiveofourown.org/) clone, StoryMd ("Story Mode") is a repository for information that can be used in a variety of ways. It can contain a categorized set of pages (such as stories and their chapters), or it can also be a repo for one overarching topic (e.g. a story), with pages for its actual content, elements, characters, settings, etc..
